# Pet List with Node JS and MongoDB

- In this lab we will be practicing querying with MongoDB with the Node JS driver.
- You should first start by cloning this repository and issuing the `npm start` to initialize the application.
- **Note:** Make sure to have installed Nodemon prior to running this command: `npm install nodemon -g`.
- Your job will be to dive into /resources and write the appropriate code as per the comments in each of the controller files.
- You can reference the Node JS MongoDB driver documentation here: http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/api.
